    <h1>Hello,</h1>
    <p>As you might have seen, my domain will be expiring. The app will still be hosted on Heroku, so there will definitely be a permanent URL: <a href="http://sutd-timetable.herokuapp.com">sutd-timetable.herokuapp.com</a>. timetables.sutd.design was just a redirect, so everything is exactly the same.</p>
	<p>However, I bothered with writing an extra page so that I could communicate. You see, I bought sutd.design last year during design in the hopes that we could showcase our design projects. To cut the story short, I never got the word out quickly enough and it was not used until I repurposed it for Timetables.</p>
	<p>It was considerably cheaper back then, but renewing the domain costs $40 now. It is not a small sum, but possibly managable if sufficient people want it enough to chip in.</p>
	<p>So, if you do want it or have any other plans/suggestions, contact me through one of the channels at <a href="http://randna.me">randna.me</a></p>
